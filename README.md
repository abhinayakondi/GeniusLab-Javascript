# My JavaScript Learning Journey

This repository documents my progress as I learn JavaScript.  
It includes example programs, practice exercises, concepts, and small experiments I’ve written along the way.  
The goal of this repo is to track my growth, stay consistent, and build a strong foundation in JavaScript.

## What’s Inside
- Basic JavaScript syntax examples  
- Variables, data types, operators  
- Functions & scope  
- Arrays, objects, and loops  
- DOM manipulation practice  
- Event handling  
- Asynchronous JavaScript (fetch, promises, async/await)  
- Small mini-projects and experiments  

Each folder and file represents a concept or topic I’ve practiced.

## Tech Used
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**
- **HTML & CSS** (for DOM-related examples)
- **Node.js** (only for running some JS files locally)
